# Carnegie Hall Digital Collections Metadata Application Profile

Site link: https://kgrons.github.io/TEST-map/

## Overview

*Last updated: April 2018*

This profile describes metadata elements for item-level asset records created and managed by the [Carnegie Hall Archives](https://www.carnegiehall.org/About/History) for its Digital Collections. The purpose of establishing this profile is to document current metadata standards, cataloging procedures, and controlled vocabularies to allow for self-assessment and interoperability across cultural institutions. Future additions to this profile will include mapping to DPLA properties, Dublin Core, and other appropriate metadata schemas. 

The elements outlined in this initial profile represent metadata for assets available within Carnegie Hall's Digital Collections. The elements represent descriptive, administrative, and technical aspects of the digital objects. These assets serve as digital representations of a broad range of archival materials including photographs, program books, flyers, posters, correspondence, and recordings to support Carnegie Hall's mission and to share our rich history with the widest possible audience. The Carnegie Hall Digital Collections are currently managed in a digital asset management system (DAMS), and we aim to present a public preview of the collection material online in the near future.

Please note this is a preliminary draft release of our metadata profile. Ask questions or share recommendations by following the [Feedback](/README.md#feedback) instructions.
